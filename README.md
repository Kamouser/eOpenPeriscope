# eOpenPeriscope
based on [gitnew2018/My-OpenPeriscope](https://github.com/gitnew2018/My-OpenPeriscope) and [Pmmlabs/OpenPeriscope](https://github.com/Pmmlabs/OpenPeriscope) [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) based OpenPeriscope. This project is going to be a major refactor to:
 - port the code to [electron](https://electronjs.org/) to enable running it on mobile phones
 - refactor the code to fix the code style and improve maintainability
 
 Will drop support for:
 -  in-browser client. While it is cool, it is not supported on mobile platforms
